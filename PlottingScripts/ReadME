The SBML version of the model is provided in the file Paenibacillus ICGEB2008 Central Carbon Metabolism.sbml

Scripts to reproduce the figures in the manuscript Adlakha et al, Biotechnol Biofuels, ‘Insight into metabolic pathways of the potential biofuel producer, Paenibacillus polymyxa ICGEB2008’ DOI 10.1186/s13068-015-0338-4 are contained in the folder PlottingScripts



To run the Scripts you need a working installation of ScrumPy (http://mudshark.brookes.ac.uk/ScrumPy) and the python bindings for CPLEX.

Plotting.py contains the scripts to create all plots, loading the model from the .spy files, setting all constraints etc.

From a Python shell, the command ‘import Plotting’ will automatically execute the scripts. 

The matlab file Plots.m can be used to make nicer plots which resemble those in the manuscript.


This software comes without any warranty and the authors will not take any responsibility for any damages caused by this software.

The scripts were tested with Python 2.7, ScrumPy revision 731, Matlab 2014b.
